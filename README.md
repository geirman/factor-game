# factors-game
This is a silly game I've refactored through the years as a learning aide. There are 3 versions; the first was written in 2001 and the next two were written in 2013. If you're curious, you can read a short blog I've written about them here. http://www.geirman.com/2013/09/javascript-my-personal-journey-rewriting-a-factors-game/
